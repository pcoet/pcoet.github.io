title: Functional programming with Ramda
category: TypeScript
---

* This post is about functional programming using TypeScript and [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/). It owes a big debt to Randy Coulman's series [Thinking in Ramda](https://randycoulman.com/blog/categories/thinking-in-ramda/), which is well worth reading in its entirety.
* Ramda functions expect function parameters first, and data parameters last.
* Composing involves building new functions out of existing functions.
* JavaScript supports first-class functions.
* Pure functions don't cause side effects. Writing pure functions is a goal of functional programming.
* In functional programming, data should be immutable.
* Map, filter, and reduce are all built-in methods on a JavaScript array, and they also exist as Ramda functions.
