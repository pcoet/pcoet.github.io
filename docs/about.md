## About the author

I'm a programmer and technical writer based in the Seattle area. Currently, I'm
interested in front-end development, functional programming, algorithms, formal
languages, natural languages, and machine learning. I studied English literature
in college and got interested in computer programming later in life. I'm still
pretty fired up about it. For the last couple of years, I've done most of my
programming in TypeScript, Go, or Python.

## About the content

The posts are primarily intended as documentation for tasks I've had to google
one time too many. If anyone else finds them useful, better still. The tutorials
assume that you're working on a Mac (or other *nix machine) and that you have
some basic familiarity with a Unix environment and with standard dev tools. For
example, the tutorials won't explain how to install Node.js or work with Git.
The info is readily available, if you need it.

## About the title

"Pcoet" is the title of a book of avant-garde poetry by David Melnick. It was
published in San Franciso in 1975. You can
[read it online](http://eclipsearchive.org/projects/PCOET/pcoet.html). I think
the title sounds a little like a mashup of "poet" and "coder."
