# About

The posts and tutorials on this site document things that I've learned &ndash;
either processes that I've refined through repetition or insights that I've
arrived at through research and investigation. I do a lot of my learning as I'm
writing.

The tutorials assume that you're working on macOS, but they should be adaptible
to Linux as well.

## About the title

First published in San Francisco in 1975, **Pcoet** is a book of avant-garde
poetry by David Melnick. You can read it
[here](http://eclipsearchive.org/projects/PCOET/pcoet.html). I borrowed the
title for my GitHub user name because it sounds sounds like a mashup of "poet"
and "coder."

## About me

I'm a programmer and technical writer based in the Seattle area. Currently, I'm
interested in programming languages, web development, functional programming,
algorithms, and machine learning. I studied English literature in college and
got interested in computer programming later in life. Working with code is now
part of my job, and writing code has provided me with new outlets for creativity
and opportunities for learning. For the last couple of years, I've done most of
my coding in TypeScript, Go, and Python.
