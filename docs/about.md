# About

Here's a little bit about me and about the *pcoet notes* project.

## About me

I'm a programmer and technical writer based in the Seattle area. Currently, I'm
interested in programming languages, web development, functional programming,
algorithms, and machine learning. I studied English literature
in college and got interested in computer programming later in life. I'm still
pretty fired up about it. For the last couple of years, I've done most of my
programming in TypeScript, Go, or Python.

## About the content

The posts and tutorials are intended to document things that I've learned
&ndash; either processes that I've refined through repetition, or insights I've
arrived at through research. I often do most of my learning as I write the
content.

The tutorials assume that you're working on macOS, but they should be adaptible
to Linux as well.

## About the title

**Pcoet** is a book of avant-garde poetry by David Melnick. It was first
published in San Franciso in 1975. You can read it
[here](http://eclipsearchive.org/projects/PCOET/pcoet.html). I think
the title sounds a little like a mashup of "poet" and "coder."
