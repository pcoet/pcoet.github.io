## About the author

I'm a programmer and technical writer based in Seattle. Currently, I'm interested in front-end development, algorithms, and machine learning.

## About the content

The posts are primarily intended as documentation for tasks I've had to google one time too many. If anyone else finds them useful, better still. The tutorials assume that you're working on a Mac (or other *nix machine) and that you have some basic familiarity with a Unix environment and with standard dev tools. For example, the tutorials won't explain how to install Node.js or work with Git. The info is readily available, if you need it.

## About the title

"Pcoet" is the title of a book of avant-garde poetry by David Melnick, published in San Franciso in 1975. You can [read it online](http://eclipsearchive.org/projects/PCOET/pcoet.html). I think the title sounds a little like a mashup of "poet" and "coder."
